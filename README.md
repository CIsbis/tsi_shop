Retrospective
During our retrospective for the first sprint, Group 3 used the sailboat analogy to examine our 
progress and identify areas for improvement. 

The wind that propelled us came from our collaborative teamwork and the collective enthusiasm 
for the project's concept. 

Our successes, represented by sunshine, included significant progress with functional elements 
of the application, notably the log-in and sign-up features, which were key components of our 
minimum viable product.

The rocks we encountered comprosed of bugs in the code due to class conflicts and unexpected 
behavior in some functions. 

The anchors that weighed us down included our limited experience with Python and gaps in our 
programming knowledge, which sometimes slowed our progress.

As we discussed our ultimate goal/vision for the project, we realised the importance 
of implementing robust testing processes to address functionality bugs. This was accompanied by a 
commitment to improving error handling for enhanced software stability. We also explored strategies to 
improve code quality through refactoring and promoting cleaner code.
