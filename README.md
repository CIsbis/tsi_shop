Introduction 

Our application is a car shop app which allows the user to buy and sell cars. first you create an account 
or log in as an existing user,
Once logged in the user can search for cars in our database using make/model/colour/year... filters 
or the user can list a car to be put into our database using the same parameters. The welcome.py is the 
applications UI this handles all the user input, calling the individual functions when prompted, our data is stored
in 2 different databases, cars.csv and customer.csv these databases are accessed with the search and add functions and 
login and signup functions.



Retrospective

During our retrospective for the first sprint, Group 3 used the sailboat analogy to examine our 
progress and identify areas for improvement. 

The wind that propelled us came from our collaborative teamwork and the collective enthusiasm 
for the project's concept. 

Our successes, represented by sunshine, included significant progress with functional elements 
of the application, notably the log-in and sign-up features, which were key components of our 
minimum viable product.

The rocks we encountered comprosed of bugs in the code due to class conflicts and unexpected 
behavior in some functions. 

The anchors that weighed us down included our limited experience with Python and gaps in our 
programming knowledge, which sometimes slowed our progress.

As we discussed our ultimate goal/vision for the project, we realised the importance 
of implementing robust testing processes to address functionality bugs. This was accompanied by a 
commitment to improving error handling for enhanced software stability. We also explored strategies to 
improve code quality through refactoring and promoting cleaner code.
